# Lifespan of fault crossing channels

This repository contains data and source code for the analysis of fault crossing channels in Dascher-Cousineau, Finnegan and Brodsky, 2021. The dataset contains measurements of channel offset, slope, drainage area, and avulsion thresholds derived from B4 lidar along the Carrizo Plain section of the San Andreas Fault. combined_v3.pdf features a map of each measurement in the dataset. Please refer to the manuscript supplement for further information of the measurement protocol.

## Quick start:

Download this repository and open Matlab (develloped using MatLab_R2020a).

`lifespan_of_fault_crossing_channel` in the command prompt produces figures 2 and 3 of Dascher-Cousineau, Finnegan and Brodsky, 2021.

`stretching_river_semi_analytical` in the command prompt produces figure S1, a semi-analytical solution to incrementally stretching a fault parallel section and subsequently evolving the channel profile in the inter-event period.
