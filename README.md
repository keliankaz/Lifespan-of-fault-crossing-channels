# Lifespan of fault crossing channels

This repository contains data and source code for the analysis of fault crossing channel in Dascher-Cousineau, Finnegan and Brodsky, 2021. The dataset contains measurements of channel offset, slope, drainage area, and avulsion thresholds derived from B4 lidar along the Carrizo Plain section of the San Andreas Fault.

## Quick start:

Download this repository and open Matlab (develloped using MatLab_R2020a).

`lifespan_of_fault_crossing_channel` in the command prompt should produce figures 2 and 3 of the manuscript.

`stretching_river_semi_analytical` in the command prompt should produce figure S1, a semi-analytical solution to incrementally stretching a fault parallel section and subsequently evolving the channel profile in the interevent period.
